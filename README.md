## Warnings
* The Backend is deployed on a free server which spins down after inactivity. The first request spins the server back up, which may take some time. The subsequent requests should be faster.
* Due to this slow server response, the payment gateway faces issues. You can download the files and host it on your localhost to get the proper response.
